ChatGPT: 

To resolve the issue with your systemd service failing to start, follow these troubleshooting steps:
1. **Check the Service Logs** 
The first step is to look at the detailed logs to understand why the service failed.


```bash
sudo journalctl -u text-expander.service
```

This command will provide detailed logs of the service’s attempts to start, which should give you more information about the failure.
2. **Verify the Shell Script** Ensure that the shell script `/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/run_text_expander.sh` is executable and has the correct shebang line. The script should look like this:**run_text_expander.sh** :

```bash
#!/bin/bash
python3 /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/main.py
```

Verify that it’s executable:


```bash
chmod +x /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/run_text_expander.sh
```

Run the script manually to check for any errors:


```bash
/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/run_text_expander.sh
```
3. **Check Python Environment** Ensure that `python3` is correctly installed and that there are no issues with the Python environment. You can also specify the full path to Python in the script if necessary. For example, find the path with:

```bash
which python3
```

Then, update your script with the absolute path:


```bash
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/python3 /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/main.py
```
4. **Check Permissions** Ensure that the user specified in the systemd service file (`meeran`) has the necessary permissions to execute the script and access the files. Check file permissions and ownership:

```bash
ls -l /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/
```
5. **Verify Service Configuration** Ensure that the systemd service configuration file (`/etc/systemd/system/text-expander.service`) is correct. It should be similar to this:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Text Expander Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/run_text_expander.sh
WorkingDirectory=/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander
User=meeran
Restart=always
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
6. **Reload and Restart the Service**

The logs suggest that the Python script is failing to execute properly. The key error message, "Failed to determine," indicates that there might be an issue with the script execution. Let’s further investigate and resolve this issue step by step:
1. **Update Logging for Better Diagnostics** Modify your `run_text_expander.sh` script to capture any errors. Update the script to include error logging:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/python3 /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/main.py > /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/error.log 2>&1
```
This will redirect standard output and errors to `error.log`.2. **Check the Error Log** Examine the `error.log` file for any Python-related errors:

```bash
cat /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/error.log
```
3. **Verify Python Script Execution** 
Manually execute the Python script to ensure it runs without errors:


```bash
/usr/bin/python3 /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/main.py
```

If it fails, there may be issues within the script itself. Review the error messages for hints.
4. **Check File Paths and Permissions** Ensure that the paths in the service file and script are correct and that the user `meeran` has permissions to access and execute these files:

```bash
ls -l /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/
```

Ensure all files are readable and executable.
5. **Service Configuration Adjustments** 
Make sure the service file is correctly configured. Here’s a recap of the configuration:
**/etc/systemd/system/text-expander.service** :

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Text Expander Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/run_text_expander.sh
WorkingDirectory=/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander
User=meeran
Restart=on-failure
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
6. **Reload and Restart Systemd** 
After making changes to the service file, reload systemd and restart the service:


```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart text-expander.service
```

### Summary 
 
- **Capture and check errors** : Update the script to log errors and review the log file.
 
- **Run the script manually** : Ensure the script works outside of the service.
 
- **Check paths and permissions** : Verify that all paths and permissions are correct.
 
- **Verify service configuration** : Ensure the systemd service file is correctly set up.

Following these steps should help identify and resolve the issue with your text expander service. If you encounter specific errors or issues, please share them for more targeted assistance.

The permissions and file details look correct, which indicates that permission issues are unlikely to be the cause. Given that the `run_text_expander.sh` script is executable and the `main.py` script also has executable permissions, let’s delve into the next steps:1. **Check the Error Log** Review the `error.log` file created by the modified `run_text_expander.sh` script to get more details about what might be failing.

```bash
cat /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/error.log
```
2. **Verify Python Script Execution** 
Run the Python script directly to check for errors:


```bash
/usr/bin/python3 /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/main.py
```
3. **Systemd Service Configuration** Revisit the systemd service configuration to ensure that the `WorkingDirectory` and `ExecStart` paths are correctly specified and that the script runs correctly in that context.Here’s a refined version of the `text-expander.service` file:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Text Expander Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/run_text_expander.sh
WorkingDirectory=/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander
User=meeran
Restart=on-failure
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
4. **Permissions and Environment** Ensure that the `meeran` user has access to all necessary files and directories, and check for any environmental dependencies.5. **Test the Shell Script Manually** 
Make sure the shell script behaves correctly. Run:


```bash
/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/run_text_expander.sh
```

Confirm that this command works as expected and no errors are shown.
6. **Review and Adjust Python Code** If the script fails when run manually, check the Python code for any environment-specific issues or additional dependencies that may be missing. Since you are using Wayland, ensure that `pynput` works well in your environment.
### Summary 
 
1. **Check `error.log`**  for detailed errors.
 
2. **Run the Python script manually**  to identify any issues.
 
3. **Verify systemd service file**  paths and settings.
 
4. **Ensure file permissions and environment**  are correct.
 
5. **Test shell script execution**  to ensure it runs without issues.
By following these steps, you should be able to identify the specific cause of the failure and resolve it. If the `error.log` or script execution provides specific errors, please share them for further analysis.

1. **
Since the script runs smoothly when executed manually, the issue likely lies in the systemd service configuration. Let’s proceed with some troubleshooting and adjustments:
1. Adjust `WorkingDirectory` in Service File** Ensure the `WorkingDirectory` is properly set in the service file. Try using an absolute path, as systemd may not correctly resolve the relative path:
Edit the service file:


```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/text-expander.service
```

Ensure the file looks like this:


```ini
[Unit]
Description=Text Expander Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/run_text_expander.sh
WorkingDirectory=/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander
User=meeran
Restart=on-failure
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
2. **Reload Systemd Daemon** 
After making the changes, reload the systemd daemon:


```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
3. **Check the Status After Restart** 
Restart the service and check its status:


```bash
sudo systemctl restart text-expander.service
sudo systemctl status text-expander.service
```
4. **Check Journal Logs** 
If the issue persists, check the logs again:


```bash
sudo journalctl -u text-expander.service
```
5. **Check for Environment or Display Server Issues** Since you’re using Wayland, ensure that any environment variables related to the display server are correctly set. Add the following line under `[Service]` in the service file to ensure compatibility with Wayland:

```ini
Environment="DISPLAY=:0"
Environment="XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/1000"
```
This sets the display and runtime directory for graphical or input-related operations, which might be relevant if `pynput` interacts with the display.6. **Run Service as a User Unit** 
If the service needs to interact with the user's session (like detecting keyboard inputs), consider running it as a user service. Move the service file to the user-level systemd directory:


```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
mv /etc/systemd/system/text-expander.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
```

Reload the user daemon:


```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

Enable and start the service as a user unit:


```bash
systemctl --user enable text-expander.service
systemctl --user start text-expander.service
```

### Summary 
 
- Ensure the **absolute paths**  are correct in the systemd service file.
 
- **Reload and restart**  the systemd daemon.
 
- Add environment variables for **Wayland compatibility** .
 
- If necessary, run the service as a **user-level unit**  for session-specific functionality.

These adjustments should help resolve the service startup issue. Let me know the outcome after these changes.

ChatGPT: 

The error message you're encountering indicates that the `text-expander.service` file does not exist in the user-level systemd directory.
Here’s how to resolve this:

### Steps to set up a user-level service: 
 
1. **Move the service file to the correct user-level directory:** 
First, create the directory for user-level systemd services if it doesn’t exist:


```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
```

Then, move your existing service file to the user-level systemd directory:


```bash
cp /etc/systemd/system/text-expander.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
```
 
2. **Reload the systemd daemon for the user:** 
Since you’re working with user-level services, reload the user systemd manager:


```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```
 
3. **Enable and start the service for the user:** 
Now you can enable and start the service under your user session:


```bash
systemctl --user enable text-expander.service
systemctl --user start text-expander.service
```
 
4. **Check the status of the service:** 
Verify that the service is running correctly:


```bash
systemctl --user status text-expander.service
```

The error `status=216/GROUP` indicates an issue with the group or user permissions while running the service under the user-level `systemd`. Here's how to resolve it:
### Steps to troubleshoot: 
 
1. **Ensure `User` and `Group` are not specified in the user service** :
For user-level services, you don't need to define the `User` or `Group` in the service file. Open the `text-expander.service` and ****Ensure `User` and `Group` are not specified in the user service** :
For user-level services, you don't need to define the `User` or `Group` in the service file. Open the `text-expander.service` and remove any `User=` or `Group=` directives** .
Edit the user service file:


```bash
nano ~/.config/systemd/user/text-expander.service
```

Make sure the content looks like this:


```ini
[Unit]
Description=Text Expander Service

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/run_text_expander.sh
WorkingDirectory=/home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander
Restart=on-failure
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
 
2. **Check the `ExecStart` path** :
Ensure the `run_text_expander.sh` script has the proper permissions and the path is correct. Run:

```bash
chmod +x /home/meeran/dotfiles/utils/text-expander/run_text_expander.sh
```
 
3. **Reload and restart the service** :
After updating the service file:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart text-expander.service
```
 
4. **Check the status again** :
Verify if it runs:

```bash
systemctl --user status text-expander.service
```

### Check for logs: 

If it still fails, check the user-level logs:


```bash
journalctl --user -xe
```
This should resolve the permission-related error (`status=216/GROUP`). Let me know the outcome!
